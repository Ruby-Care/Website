It’s a long phase that unfolds over months and years. What breaks survivorship care today isn’t medical expertise. It’s what happens after treatment, when structure disappears and patients are left without guidance between appointments. Ruby Care exists to make recovery a supported, continuous process — for both specialists and patients."
